### Bytecode Explanation

- **`LOAD_ATTR` (0x97)**: Loads an attribute from an object on the stack.
- **`LOAD_CONST` (0x64)**: Pushes a constant from `co_consts` array onto the stack.
- **`STORE_FAST` (0x7D)**: Pops the top of the stack and stores it into a local variable.
- **`LOAD_FAST` (0x7C)**: Pushes the local variable value onto the stack.
- **`BINARY_ADD` (0x7A)**: Adds the top two values on the stack.
- **`RETURN_VALUE` (0x53)**: Returns the top value from the stack as the function’s result.
- **Padding**: Used for alignment.

Bytecode Breakdown
Bytecode Offset: Position in the bytecode sequence.
Opcode: Numeric representation of the bytecode instruction.
Operand: Extra data associated with the opcode.
Description: A textual description of what the opcode does.
Opcode Name: The name of the bytecode instruction.
Operand Value: The value used in the instruction (if any).
Stack Operation: What happens to the stack during this operation.
Notes: Additional information about the opcode or operation.

An attribute of an object in Python is a characteristic or behavior of that object

Code Object: A data structure that includes the bytecode as well as other metadata about the code.
Bytecode: A sequence of low-level instructions that the Python interpreter executes, contained within the code object.

## Python Source Code Structure

The Python source code repository contains various directories and files, but the core structure can be categorized into several main areas:

- Python Runtime Core: Contains the fundamental parts of the Python interpreter.
- Standard Library: The collection of modules and packages that come with Python.
- Tools and Utilities: Includes scripts and tools for building, testing, and managing Python.

## Important Components of the Python Interpreter

pythonrun.c: Contains the main entry point of the Python interpreter.
ceval.c: Implements the evaluation loop, responsible for executing bytecode.
compile.c: Handles the compilation of Python source code into bytecode.
bltinmodule.c: Contains implementations of built-in functions and objects.
object.c: Defines fundamental Python objects such as integers, floats, and strings.
pyframe.c: Manages the execution frames, which represent the call stack during execution.
